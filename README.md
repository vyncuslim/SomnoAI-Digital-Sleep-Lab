## 🚀 Dual-Node Strategy (半开源架构)

SomnoAI adopts a **"Strategic Physical Isolation"** model to balance community transparency with core intellectual property protection.

### 1. SomnoAI-frontend (Public Node)
- **Status**: [PUBLIC] MIT License
- **Scope**: UI/UX, data visualization, client-side routing, and Gemini API orchestration.
- **Goal**: Provide a professional, high-performance interface for laboratory subjects.

### 2. SomnoAI-core (Sovereign Node)
- **Status**: [PRIVATE] Proprietary
- **Scope**: Neural synthesis algorithms, proprietary prompt engineering, model weights, and sensitive data processing logic.
- **Goal**: The "Engine" of SomnoAI. Protected to ensure long-term competitive advantage.

### 3. SomnoAI-docs (Public Node)
- **Status**: [PUBLIC]
- **Scope**: Architecture diagrams, Whitepapers, and Protocol Documentation.
- **Goal**: Strategic display of system capabilities.

## 🛠️ Security & Asset Management

- **Zero-Key Policy**: No API Keys or database credentials are ever committed to the Public Node.
- **Strict Git-Ignore**: All `.env`, `*.pt`, and `*.ckpt` files are physically restricted from the public stream.
- **API Boundary**: The frontend interacts with the core through secure, authenticated neural relays.
