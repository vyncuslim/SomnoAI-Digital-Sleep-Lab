## 🚀 Core Architecture

- **Neural Synthesis Engine**: Advanced multi-modal analysis of sleep architecture powered by Google Gemini models.
- **Biometric Telemetry**: Real-time visualization of neurological recovery, heart rate stability, and metabolic load.
- **Secure Edge Processing**: Zero-backend storage policy. All physiological data is processed in-browser.

## ⚖️ Semi-Open Strategy (Dual-Node)

SomnoAI utilizes a **Hybrid Architecture** to balance transparency and research sovereignty:

- **Public UI Node (MIT License)**: Frontend source code, layout, and visualization components are public.
- **Private Core Node (Proprietary)**: Deep neural synthesis logic, proprietary prompt engineering, and security audit protocols are managed in a private repository.

## 🛠️ Security

- **Environment Separation**: API keys and database credentials are NEVER hardcoded.
- **Audit Logs**: All access events are logged via encrypted Supabase channels.
